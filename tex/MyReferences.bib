By looking at the local structure of the coefficient matrix and performing a recursive set of variable eliminations, combined with a simplification of the resulting coarse level problems, we obtain bases better suited for problems with inhomogeneous (spatially varying) data, smoothness, and boundary constraints. Our approach removes the need to heuristically adjust the optimal number of preconditioning levels, significantly outperforms previously proposed approaches, and also maps cleanly onto data-parallel architectures such as modern GPUs.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

It provides detailed experimental comparisons of these techniques and their variants, including an analysis of relative computational costs and how these impact practical algorithm performance. We derive both theoretical convergence rates based on the condition numbers of the systems and their preconditioners, and empirical convergence rates drawn from real-world problems. We also develop new techniques for sparsifying higher connectivity problems, and compare our techniques to existing and newly developed variants such as algebraic and combinatorial multigrid. Our experimental results demonstrate that, except for highly irregular problems, adaptive hierarchical basis function preconditioners generally outperform alternative multigrid techniques, especially when computational complexity is taken into account.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

Our approach interleaves the selection of fine-and coarse-level variables with the removal of weak connections between potential fine-level variables (sparsification) and the compensation for these changes by strengthening nearby connections. By applying these operations before each elimination step and repeating the procedure recursively on the resulting smaller systems, we obtain a highly efficient multi-level preconditioning scheme with linear time and memory requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that our new scheme outperforms or is comparable with other state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of operation count and wall-clock time. This speedup is achieved by the new method's ability to reduce the condition number of irregular Laplacian matrices as well as homogeneous systems. It can therefore be used for a wide variety of computational photography problems, as well as several 3D mesh processing tasks, without the need to carefully match the algorithm to the problem characteristics.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

While gradient-domain compositing is powerful and widely used, it suffers from poor scalability. Computing an n pixel composite requires solving a linear system with n variables; solving such a large system quickly overwhelms the main memory of a standard computer when performed for multi-megapixel composites, which are common in practice. In this paper we show how to perform gradient-domain compositing approximately by solving an O(p) linear system, where p is the total length of the seams between image regions in the composite; for typical cases, p is O(√n). We achieve this reduction by transforming the problem into a space where much of the solution is smooth, and then utilize the pattern of this smoothness to adaptively subdivide the problem domain using quadtrees. We demonstrate the merits of our approach by performing panoramic stitching and image region copy-and-paste in significantly reduced time and memory while achieving visually identical results.}, booktitle = {ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 Papers}, pages = {94–es}, location = {San Diego, California}, series = {SIGGRAPH '07}
